This is the home of the documentation for all of Norland Productions' resources. It will include the dependencies, setup and configuration for all of our scripts.

Norland Productions was established in 2023 and was originally intended for the creation of scripts on our own server. Soon after, the studio was abandoned
only to get picked back up in 2025 for the creation of high quality public scripts for the [Cfx.re Platform](https://cfx.re)

If you have any pre-sale questions you can ask them in the public [questions channel](https://discord.com/channels/1337352930088583220/1337366947397898341)
on our [Discord Server](https://norland.productions/discord). If you do not receive an answer that you are satisfied with then please feel free to
[open a ticket.](https://discord.com/channels/1337352930088583220/1337361236781830214)

A similar process applies for customers with questions about a script that they have purchased. Please ask in the private & customers only
[support channel](https://discord.com/channels/1337352930088583220/1337364477959606293) first, just in case someone has had the same issue as you and has
managed to resolve it so that they can guide you through it. If you don't get an answer that you are satisfied with then please feel free to
[open a ticket.](https://discord.com/channels/1337352930088583220/1337361236781830214)
